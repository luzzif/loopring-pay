The app is hosted on IPFS and accessible [here](https://rails.eth.link).

## Generating the IPFS content id

You can get Rails' unique IPFS content id by simply cloning the repo, installing all the dependencies through `yarn`, and running `yarn build`. After the build folder is generated, you can run `ipfs add -rn` on it to get back its content id.
